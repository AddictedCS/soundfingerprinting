    <releaseNotes>Version 4.0.0 comes with a list of improvements. New Haar wavelet transformation normalization factor is now set-up as the default one. It yields better recall and accuracy. Re-index fingerprints if you are migrating from v3.x. Most important update in v4 is an improved fingerprinting speed (2 mins of audio are fingerprinted in ~300 ms), with a lot fever bytes used throughout the process. Similarly to v3.2.0  the InMemoryModelService can now be serialized to file system, and reloaded on application startup (useful for scenarios when you don't want to add external data storages). QueryResult now contains Stats information about number of candidates analyzed during query, as well as segregated query duration information: QueryDuration and FingerprintingDuration. Fingerprinting and Query configurations are simplified with various profiles available for choise: LowLatency, Default and HighPrecision configurations. Choose one that corresponds to your scenario. Check Solr datasource for a fast persistent storage for fingerprints https://github.com/AddictedCS/soundfingerprinting.solr</releaseNotes>
