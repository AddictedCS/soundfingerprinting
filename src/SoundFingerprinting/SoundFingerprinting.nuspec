    <releaseNotes>Version 3.2.0 comes with a list of improvements and bug fixes. The InMemoryModelService can now be serialized to file system, and reloaded on application startup (useful for scenarious when you don't want external data storages). QueryResult now contains Stats information about number of candidates analyzed during query, as well as segregated query duration information: QueryDuration and FingerprintingDuration. Fingerprinting and Query configurations are simplified with various profiles available for choise: LowLatency, Default and HighPrecision configurations. Choose one that corresponds to your scenario. Un4seen.Bass was upgraded to 2.4.12, with matching SoundFingerprinting.Audio.Bass v3.2.0. AudioService interface contains additional method that allows getting the length of the audio file (useful for TrackData insertion). All users of 3.x are encouraged to migrate to 3.2.x, and re-insert all the fingerprints in the datasource since the signature of the fingerprints has changed. Check Solr datasource for a fast persistent storage for fingerprints https://github.com/AddictedCS/soundfingerprinting.solr</releaseNotes>
